How quick, simple, and cheap can the web2 stack be in 2024?
Part of the larger experiment organized at [coldstart](https://github.com/zootella/coldstart).
[One person](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318)
exploring pouring and curing a
tiny [monolith](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/).

This is 🍺 [cold3.cc](https://cold3.cc/) on [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/) using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

Notes:

```
./ is the Nuxt site for Cloudflare
$ npm run local
$ npm run deploy

./net23 is a Serverless Framework project for AWS
$ npm run local
$ npm run deploy

./icarus is a Vite project to code the library with TDD
$ npm run icarus

./library is a Node project with common functions used everywhere
$ node test
```

## Make a new site on Cloudflare

```
$ npm create cloudflare@latest
$ cd cold3
```

 * Sign into Cloudflare and keep that browser forward, as the terminal will pop open a tab to authenticate
 * Use a fancy terminal like PowerShell; MING64 can't do the interactive menus
 * Chose *Website or web app*, *Nuxt*; yes, *use Git for version control*, and yes, *Deploy your application to Cloudflare*
 * Previously fixed error during `create` by updating npm with `$ npm install -g npm`

## Check or correct wrangler authentication

```
$ npx wrangler --version
$ npx wrangler whoami
$ npx wrangler login
```

Previously fixed a mess on Windows where wrangler was installed globally, and had an expired or incorrectly permissioned OAuth token.
Wranger should be installed in the project, only.
Deleted `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\npm\wrangler.ps1` and `C:\Users\UserName\.wrangler`.
Also deleted `cold3/.wrangler` and `cold3/node_modules` and repeated `npm install`.

## Make a new repo on GitHub

```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:zootella/cold3.git
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main
```

GitHub, *Repositories*, *New*.
Type name and description, but start with no readme, gitignore, or license to make a completely blank repository

## Push to GitHub

```
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -a -n -m "note"
$ git push
```

Pushing to GitHub does not start Cloudflare deploy; they're separate and I like that better.

## Run locally and deploy to Cloudflare

```
$ npm run local
$ npm run deploy

previously
$ npm run dev
$ npm run pages:dev
$ npm run pages:deploy
```

 * Vite is on another port, but Nuxt up top runs locally at 3000
 * Unlike Amplify, builds locally and pushes static assets, which is faster
 * `dev` runs Vite for Nuxt, while `pages:dev` and `pages:deploy` run Wrangler, which in turn runs Vite for Nuxt
 * `pages:dev` works great everywhere; in React-land, a problem between Wrangler and webpack breaks local development

## Nuxt commands

```
$ npx nuxi add component ColdComponent
$ npx nuxi add page page1
```

Git diff makes it look like these commands aren't adding configuration outside the obvious news folders and files, which is good.

## Domains and DNS

Getting the domain name attached was all about clicking forms in web dashboards.
Registered the domain at a separate registrar, not Cloudflare.

Followed both of these trails in the Cloudflare dashboard:
 * dash top, *Websites*, *Add a site* button
 * dash top, *Workers & Pages*, *Overview*, `cold3`, *Custom domains* tab

Typed just `cold3.cc` even though some examples start `www`.
*Begin DNS transfer* is correct.
Beneath paid options, the *Free* one is fine.
Turned off *Proxied* and instead choose *DNS only*, even though individual records ended up *Proxied* as shown below.

Cloudflare gave you two nameservers, which you pasted into the registrar, there switching from parking *Basic DNS* to third-party *Custom DNS*.

Cloudflare imported existing DNS records from the registrar, which were all about parking and you should discard entirely. Removed `MX` and `TXT` records and edited to have just two like this:

```
AAAA   www       100::            Proxied  Auto
CNAME  cold3.cc  cold3.pages.dev  Proxied  Auto
```

During DNS propegation, Cloudflare had a button *Check nameservers now*, and after, the message *Good news! Cloudflare is now protecting your site*.
Text said wait 24 hours, but things started working in less than 30 minutes.
After that was the *Quick Start Guide*, wizard steps where you configured:

```
Automatic HTTPS Rewrites: ON
Always use HTTPS: ON
Brotli: ON
```

Then in the *Workers & Pages* area, *Custom Domains*, *Set up a custom domain*.
There was a note about changing an `A` record to a `CNAME` record, then *Activate domain*.
A row expanded with more stuff to click, ignored that, in less than a minute the yellow *Verifying* changed to green *Active*.

These steps were enough to get `http://` to redirect to `https://`, but more was necessary to get `www.cold3.cc` to redirect to just `cold3.cc`:
Dash top, left column, *Bulk Redirects*.
One rule will contain one list, and that list will contain one or several redirects.
Make one like this:

```
Source URL     Target URL        Status
www.cold3.cc/  https://cold3.cc  301
```

## Test redirects

Here are some links to test `http -> https` and `www -> (no subdomain)`.
The redirects need to keep the route.

No route:
[plain www](http://www.cold3.cc),
[plain apex](http://cold3.cc), and
[secure www](https://www.cold3.cc) should all redirect to
[secure apex](https://cold3.cc)

Route to `page1`:
[plain www](http://www.cold3.cc/page1),
[plain apex](http://cold3.cc/page1), and
[secure www](https://www.cold3.cc/page1) should all redirect to
[secure apex](https://cold3.cc/page1)

To get this working, you went into another part of the Cloudflare dashboard.
Dash top, *Websites*, `cold3.cc`, *Rules*, *Page Rules*, this uses one of your three free ones.

```
www.cold3.cc/*       url
Forwarding URL       setting
301                  status code
https://cold3.cc/$1  destination
```

## Environment variables

Set secret API keys as environment variables that running code can access, but do not appear in code.
For deployment, set them in the Cloudflare dashboard, and server-side code like */server/api/mirror.ts* can access them with `process.env.TOKEN_SECRET_1`.

In development, put them in an `.env` file in the project root, as below, and make sure `.gitignore` ignores it.

```
TOKEN_SECRET_1=secret_value_1
TOKEN_SECRET_2=secret_value_2
```

Running locally in development mode, API code can access them the same way, at `process.env.TOKEN_SECRET_1`.

To get them in a component, you have to do more.
Add a section to *nuxt.config.ts*:

```
  runtimeConfig: {
    tokenSecret1: process.env.TOKEN_SECRET_1,
    public: {
      tokenSecret2: process.env.TOKEN_SECRET_2
    }
  }
```

And then in a component's `<script>`:

```
const config = useRuntimeConfig()
log(config.public.tokenSecret2)
```

Hydration in Universal Rendering means that a component's script can run on the server and the client.
Configured as above, only the `public` token should be sent to the client.
But, it's simpler to not configure or access these keys for use in a component, and just use them in API code which only runs on the server.

## icarus, and library

```
$ cd icarus
$ npm run icarus

http://localhost:5173/
```

* And then see `log()` output and work on library functions; `Ctrl+S` closes the loop. Enjoy lightning-quick TDD red-green-refactor cycles and developer bliss.
* `level0.js` requires no imports; `level1.js` needs the imports in package.json. Functions in here could be useful to other projects. Project-specific stuff goes in named `.js` files alongside.
* Design guideline to keep components as short and empty as possible, and factor everything down as far as possible.

## Roster

Stack

[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) the framework, which includes:
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for components and dom-diffing;
[Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for pages and routes;
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) the bundler;
[Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) the server engine; and
[nuxi](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/add) Nuxt's command line interface.

Hosting

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and
[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

big areas still to explore, try out, and choose:

* spelunking to a serverless database with pinia, some orm, a proven serverless database provider avoiding vendor lock-in. maybe supabase, prisma, drizzle orm. find []local offline development, []spreadsheet-like visual data editor, and []csv export and import
* pretty components and fonts, maybe nuxt ui which is on tailwindcss, or primevue, vuesax
* authentication, including wallets
* media file upload, resize, encode, download. maybe separate and ec2
* open graph protocol cards

>security

best thinking you've found on security
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

nuxt module that does it for you
https://nuxt.com/modules/security

but csrf is off by default
https://nuxt-security.vercel.app/documentation/middleware/csrf

security related list of things to do
make two example projects side by side to compare and test in a cleanroom
at some point, you need to restart the project with current wranger and nuxt
add the security module
configure to turn on csrf protection
measure how much this slows things down
understand how you can still test apis running locally
see that before you could hit an api directly in the browser, now you can't
even better, simulate hitting an api from another domain

>form validation

https://ui.nuxt.com/components/form
mentions Yup, Zod, Joi, or Valibot
zod and joi look current and popular
pick one for email; write your test about gmail periods and lowercase names

it seems these don't do phone numbers, and this does
https://www.npmjs.com/package/libphonenumber-js
```
