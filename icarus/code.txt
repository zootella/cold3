a code challenge proves a link between
	address == browser tag
to then sign in a user, which is a link between
             browser tag == user tag
think about these relationships, fundamentally, when designing today



















[]per code, dead in 20 minutes
[x]per code, dead after 4 tries
[x]per code, dead on issued replacement

[x]per address, can't send another code if there are already 10 in the past 24 hours
[x]per address, first two codes in 5 days right away, then 5 minutes delay between codes
[x]per address, first two codes in 5 days length 4, then length codes are 6

[x]per user, first one code in 5 days no prefix, then random letter prefix

b: browser tag
u: user tag
t: code tag
a: address
code: full correct code
letter: prefix letter


event 1 >>>> can we send a code to address a?

let p = await codePermissionToAddress({userTag, v})//can we send another code now?
p.isPermitted true
p.useLength 4 or 6
p.userCodeCount how many codes we've ever sent this user, the alphabet index

event 2 >>>> send a code to address a

let index = p.userCodeCount
let code = makeRandomCode(p.useLength)
actually send it using the email or sms api
let codeTag = await codeRecordSend({userTag, type, v, index, code})

if this user has a currently live code to that address, we need to invalidate it!


event 3 >>>> is this page expecting the user to type in a received code?




also realized when a code expires, the box should disappear on the page!
the page will have its own timer for this
and should probably disappear a minute early, too! (or say 20 minutes but actually it's 25, actually, the grace period)


event 4 >>>> the user has entered a code

steps 4a, we need to validate it

steps 4b, and, it's incorrect:

steps 4c, or, it's correct:





thinking having stepped away
- now that you have code_table, should you use that instead of trail_table?
- you're not just validating the address, you're also checking the person at the device, so for security, you should make it so the catch box only appears on the same browser where the person entered the address to challenge





to make a code
1 let permission = await codePermissionToAddress(addressNormal)//check permission
2 let codeTag = Tag()//generate identifying tag
3 let code = randomCode(permission.useLength)


















ok, but seriously
it may be possible to do this all with trail_table
but way simpler to reason about if you also make code_table

code_table

row_tag
row_tick
hide - use to revoke

browser_tag
user_tag
code_text "1234" "B1234" "D123456"
guesses - 0, 1, 2

	store when we've sent a new code to address a
	when and how many codes we've sent to address a



//when and how many codes we've sent to address a
	//from this we can rate limit making a new code, and choose the code prefix presence and length
	//from this we can tell if a guess is correct or not

store(`${t} wrong guess`)//user entered a guess that's wrong
	//from this we can count wrong guesses
store(`${t} dead`)//code killed by one correct guess, a fourth wrong guess, or being replaced by a new code
	//we have to check this to make sure a code is still live







trailtable lets you hash a message that says anything
and see how many times it's been recorded
and when each time was recorded

start with simplest happy path interaction

new person navigates to page
browser assigns browser tag
they don't have a user tag

person enters new valid sms number, presses send code
server assigns user tag, provisional user
server texts code

person enters code into box
server has proof that this user controls this address
user isn't provisional anymore, now they're standard
server signs user into browser

user goes to browser on different device
browser assigns browser tag

user enters same valid sms number, presses send code
server finds existing user tag, but doesn't sign in user
server texts code

user enters code into box
server has proof that this is the same user as before
server signs user into browser



there's going to be another component that receives the code
when does it show up?
when this browsertag has a live code
see if you can do this without involving the user tag




server receives send code
has this information
- browser tag, reported, always present
- address, reported, always present
- user tag, derived

derived user tag can be:
- standard, user is signed into the browser
- provisional, we're tracking a person at this browser who has entered some information
- absent

address can be:
- known and controlled by an existing user
- known but not controlled
- never seen before

simpler

user tag is standard, not
address is controlled, not

standard user signed into this browser, address controlled:
	a signed in standard user typed another user's address--send no code!
standard user signed into this browser, address not controlled:
	user is adding additional address, send a code
no standard user signed into this browser, address controlled:
	user is signing into additional browser, send a code
no standard user signed into this browser, address not controlled:
	person is all new, send a code

ok, now all you have to define is
how do you get user tag is here and standard (you have a function for this)
tell me about this address, is it controlled by a user or not (next, make tables and functions for this)




simplest happy path
new person navigates browser, gets browser tag
enters new address, presses submit
endpoint has browser tag, no user tag, brand new address
server makes random code, sends it to address
site knows code for this browser is live, puts up catch box
person types code into catch box
server sees that code is valid, does three things
- makes standard user tag
- signs user into browser
- identifies address as controlled by user





user tag can be present (a user is signed in here) or absent (browser not signed in)

possibilities
address is
- never seen it before
- validated by an existing user



have we seen this address before







soon, to make sure you've got the provisional  user tag right
users will type in dob first
and imagine the flow that starts with credit card number




/*
1 send a sms (don't deploy) or do but they also have to be signed in using the old system? weird but maybe. or, it doesn't actually send deployed until you remove that, which can be soon
2 put in limits (code dies in 20min, 4 tries, or sent replacement; two codes rigth away fine; then 5min apart; address limited to 10 messages in 24h or 20h cooldown; )
3 record in address_table (user enters address, which is Challenged. Proven. Removed.)
4 generate or tie to user tag, user tag is generated on first address submission so you always have browser tag and user tag
*/



	<!-- ttd february, enterkeyhint showing up on iphone keyboard, maybe because you're using and changing :disabled. so you could try to fix that, mostly out of curiosity, or not use it at all, to direct the user's attention back to the page, which is probably what you want to do for usability and consistancy. no, it's because you haven't done the enclosing form with submit prevent yet -->
	<button
		:disabled="refButtonState != 'green'"
		:class="refButtonState"
		@click="clickedSend"
		class="pushy"
	>Send Code</button>
	<!-- how does :class and class together work?! -->


	<!-- how does :class and class together work?! -->






first, just do email
then do the thing where you ask email or phone
you could make a box that accepts either, but then can't show the number mobile keyboard
so, separate boxes




async function clickedSend() {
	//ttd february - doing this right here now but pretty sure it should be in a store? or at least protected with try catch??

	let r = await $fetch('/api/code', {
		method: 'POST',
		body: {
			action: 'Send.',
			browserTag: helloStore.browserTag,
			phone: refPhone.value,
		}
	})
	log(look(r))
	//bookmark february, get those to the backend!
}







a user might request a code to their address once to sign up
and again, the next day, to sign in a second device

another user might specify codes to that address as their second factor authentication
either for sudo hour
or for a single transaction

the first user will have two codes sent
the second user will have lots of codes sent

it would be great if address_table just recorded challenges and validations
and didn't care what they were for
but of course, if user1 has validated address1 with code1
and then (either to second factor or sign in another device) requests code2
but never validates it (they get sidetracked)
user1 *still* controls address1!
so make sure your rules allow for that






later, be able to add "Is +1 789 555 1234 still your number? [Yes] [No]" "Is name@example.com still your email? [Yes] [No]"
do that if the haven't validated it in 6 months or whatever, either initial validation, or a later validation for sudo hour or individual destructive transaction permission
also, if they say no, but that's the only way you have to identify them, what do you do?






a nice thing about address_table is, unlike browser_table, it doesn't have to be super fast
a returning user can navigate to the site, be signed in, get their feed, all without touching address_table
if things like adding, validating, removing an address take half-seconds of database round trips, that's fine

so, you can do more processing in the worker after getting more rows
and you don't need to hide rows to make queries easy




wait, validated should be verified




simple happy path you're coding
user signs up on browser1, validating his email
user signs in on browser2, validating that same email
and at that point, you need to code
cold3.cc/settings
and on it, there will be a list of addresses, both challenged and validated
and links like _Verify_ and _Remove_
all of this needs to be on your plate right now













there is a function
