^and have those count up in time on the page, soft melt to next five second increment
or actually just say the time it was sent, because that will match the email time
and you don't have to refresh the duration that counts forward


================================================================================

more text you could add later to the code email:
Codes last 20 minutes.
A browser in 🇺🇸 Akron OH 44321 US requested a code to this address.

and as another feature after that:

"A Chrome browser on a Samsung Galaxy phone"
"A Firefox browser on a Microsoft Surface tablet"
"A Safari browser on an Apple iPad tablet"
"An Edge browser on a Windows laptop"
"A Chrome browser on a MacBook desktop"
"A Samsung Internet browser on a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet"
"A Brave browser on a Linux desktop"
"A Chrome browser on a Google Pixel phone"
and be ready to shorten the sentence rather than saying unknown or default, maybe clearlist common ones so only they show up
so even if you get "Samsung Internet" from ua parser you just say "A browser" because the user might be using that, but not know it by that brand
Firefox, Chrome, Safari, "browser"
iPhone, Samsung, Mac
phone, tablet, laptop, PC, "device"
yeah, you could make this complicated





================================================================================

trailtable lets you hash a message that says anything
and see how many times it's been recorded
and when each time was recorded

start with simplest happy path interaction

new person navigates to page
browser assigns browser tag
they don't have a user tag

person enters new valid sms number, presses send code
server assigns user tag, provisional user
server texts code

person enters code into box
server has proof that this user controls this address
user isn't provisional anymore, now they're standard
server signs user into browser

user goes to browser on different device
browser assigns browser tag

user enters same valid sms number, presses send code
server finds existing user tag, but doesn't sign in user
server texts code

user enters code into box
server has proof that this is the same user as before
server signs user into browser




================================================================================

standard user signed into this browser, address controlled:
	a signed in standard user typed another user's address--send no code!
standard user signed into this browser, address not controlled:
	user is adding additional address, send a code
no standard user signed into this browser, address controlled:
	user is signing into additional browser, send a code
no standard user signed into this browser, address not controlled:
	person is all new, send a code

ok, now all you have to define is
how do you get user tag is here and standard (you have a function for this)
tell me about this address, is it controlled by a user or not (next, make tables and functions for this)




================================================================================

soon, to make sure you've got the provisional user tag right
users will type in dob first
and imagine the flow that starts with credit card number

another common path
the user is lazy, and never enters the code
they return to the same browser
they start a "i want back in here" flow on another browser
you need to solve this without:
- annoying the user
- letting the user fat finger their way to a starting mess of two accounts






================================================================================

quick thinking about the actual flow
common lazy happy path
user visits site on phone
Sign Up, Log In separate
chooses Sign Up
enters birthday
E-mail, Phone, other ways, separate
chooses Email
enters address
ignores code

returns next day
still signed in? yes, because provisional user tied to browser tag

goes to laptop
chooses Sign In
enters birthday
E-mail, Phone, other ways, separate
chooses Email
enters address
(at this oint the system can detect things generally look lazy and clean:)
- this user is new and low risk
- the address is only mentioned twice
so, we sign the user in (now they do have to have a user tag, maybe they got it yesterday on their phone)
and also repeat the code (maybe they'll enter it now)

hmmm... still thinking and gaming out you need to do here


================================================================================

a user might request a code to their address once to sign up
and again, the next day, to sign in a second device

another user might specify codes to that address as their second factor authentication
either for sudo hour
or for a single transaction

the first user will have two codes sent
the second user will have lots of codes sent

it would be great if address_table just recorded challenges and validations
and didn't care what they were for
but of course, if user1 has validated address1 with code1
and then (either to second factor or sign in another device) requests code2
but never validates it (they get sidetracked)
user1 *still* controls address1!
so make sure your rules allow for that


================================================================================

later, be able to add
"Is +1 789 555 1234 still your number? [Yes] [No]"
"Is name@example.com still your email? [Yes] [No]"
do that if the haven't validated it in 6 months or whatever, either initial validation, or a later validation for sudo hour or individual destructive transaction permission
also, if they say no, but that's the only way you have to identify them, what do you do?
