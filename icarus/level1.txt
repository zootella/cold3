now you're thinking you're not going to use password at all
bad, earlier, because users choose weak ones, choose compromised ones, or write them on post it notes
bad, currently, because tech giants are trying to steal them all into their security key system, and they lead to all kinds of confusing popups
so then you can probably comment out a lot of sections on several levels, even
and you don't have to make the password strength meter

all in all, this is not as annoying as the magic link thing,
because that's annoying when the site is constantly logging you out














for the name validation rules
research what current popular platforms do--you haven't done enough research for this to design it properly
which is a really good idea, and you coded it all without doing that
for isntance, if x allows a name that you do not, that's a problem, as you want useres to be able to take the same name

//scrap notes; you do have a working deindent in level0, you just realized

/*
deindent
the first line will be blank
the second line, the whitespace that starts it, must be removed from later lines
actually just remove tabs, spaces after tabs stay, spaces stay
later lines, that number of spaces, remove them
the last line will be just whitespace, omit it
