since adding sharp to lambdas, you've seen reliability problems!
like a 500 internal server error that is corrected by hitting refresh in the browser
and, the cold start is apparent now--a first hit in the morning takes seconds, then after that it's fast
so make this bridge first hit a wakup endpoint, and then do the real request
this simple stateless workaround won't slow things down much and is way easier than trying to clean up a failed request will preventing duplicate stateful real world action, like sending the user two text messages instead of one

ok, the flow is
1 do warm call
2 if failed, do warm call again
3 do real call

and log alerts when second warm call fails, meaning you don't try

very brief notes about logging:

do use console log and console error, they go to local terminal, amazon cloudwatch, and maybe later cloudflare, too

log sinks include:
-icarus textarea
-node write file
-browser inspector
-bash command line
-amazon dashboard
-cloudflare dashboard
-datadog

types of logs include:
-temporary for development, DEBUG, dog()
-unusual to investigate, ALERT, logAlert()
-record of transaction, AUDIT, logAudit()

parts of a complete log:
-type, like DEBUG, ALERT, AUDIT
-tag, so you know if it's a different log or the same log twice
-tick, so you know when it happened, machine and human readable here also, please
-cloud true or not
-environment detection and tags
-title, one or just a few words
-longer message, composed message that describes easily
-human readable watch, like from look()
-machine complete watch, like from JSON.stringify()
-size of all that before you send it to datadog, so you know if this is going to impact your bill

log exceptions at the top of the call stack, not at the bottom
so, not in toss(), but rather around door

general checks
[]everywhere you call console log and console error directly, shouldn't they go through this system?
general questions
[]what do you do with a caught exception after logging to datadog has failed?
future expeditions
[]errors on the page, how do they get to datadog? through a fetch to api, i guess, but then they're not trusted? what's the right nuxt way to deal with these?

/*
november, check then remove this duplicate essay about logging:

copying here, an essay you wrote about loggin'

i want to use datadog for a variety of purposes. for instance, here are four:
(1 "robin") high frequency performance analysis: logs of different named attempts, their duration, and success, failure, or timeout. there could be a lot of these (many per second). also, the app will need to query them, to find out what's working quickly and reliably, and get percentiles over recent time periods
(2 "audit") verbose documentation of third party api performance: here, the logs will be longer, and contain json of objects that go perhaps several references deep. with this use case, there's no querying--this is for archival, only. later on, if an api is misbehaving, developers may go into datadog to look at this record to try to determine the cause
(3 "alert") important and immediate information for developers: let's say a truly exceptional exception occurs, like code that we wrote that's part of our app throws, in a way that should be impossible. this third category of logs (top level uncaught exceptions) needs to be extremely verbose, separate from the other two types, and immediately for the attention of the development team
(4 "debug") current development in deployed environment: when coding, a developer might use console.log to see some variables they're watching in code as it runs. then, when deployed, it can be useful to also see those kinds of logs. on the next push, these log statements might be removed. and, these logs are meant to be throwaway--they won't be saved, and they won't be consistent

... to begin, a brief essay about logs and logging. ahem... .....
.................................................................
... log('note', s1, o2) .........................................
.................................................................
log is our wrapper on console.log, which adds the time and works with icarus
use with look() to see into objects with types, values, and structure
when you're done with code, log calls should already be removed
.................................................................
... dog('note', s1, o2) ........................... [DEBUG] .....
.................................................................
dog is like log, but it goes to datadog, too
also just for development, this is if you want to see what code is doing that's deployed
in datadog, dog logs are tagged debug
.................................................................
... logAudit('title', {w1, w2}) ................... [AUDIT] .....
.................................................................
we want to keep an audit trail of every use of every third-party api
for instance, did we try to send this email? charge this credit card? how did the api respond?
audit logs get saved in datadog both from local and cloud deployed code, because the use of the api was real
.................................................................
... logAlert('title', {e, w1, w2}) ................ [ALERT] .....
.................................................................
in every entrypoint where your code starts running, have a try block that catches and sends to alert
this means that a mistake you didn't intend, a truly exceptional circumstance, has otherwise gone uncaught
in deployed cloud code only, alert logs to to datadog; from there they should wake up the fellow on pager duty!
.................................................................
... ROBIN .......................................................
.................................................................
not here but related is the round robin system of api use
functions will record duration and success of higher level user tasks, like entering a code in a text message
robin won't use datadog, but rather two tables in postgres
.................................................................
... RUM .........................................................
.................................................................
so all that's great, but is the real experience of real users on the site fast?
for that, we'll incorporate real user monitoring, probably datadog's product, which is separate from logs
the run script on client side pages communicates with their back end, and makes nice charts for us to review
.................................................................
... the end .....................................................

/*
robin will do two pretty cool things:
(1) if an external api breaks, even silently, robin will notice and immediately stop using it
(2) while several comparable apis are working, robin will know which one lets users complete tasks the fastest
and it does this not on simulated use, but rather watching real users' real interactions

the design is simple:
-the table schema is generalized so code can track a new resource and provider just by mentioning it
-p50 and p95 are calculated by postgres directly, so server code doesn't need to do that
-short term and full history tables allow for both moment to moment awareness, and a full historical record
