notes for level1





now you're thinking you're not going to use password at all
bad, earlier, because users choose weak ones, choose compromised ones, or write them on post it notes
bad, currently, because tech giants are trying to steal them all into their security key system, and they lead to all kinds of confusing popups
so then you can probably comment out a lot of sections on several levels, even
and you don't have to make the password strength meter

all in all, this is not as annoying as the magic link thing,
because that's annoying when the site is constantly logging you out














for the name validation rules
research what current popular platforms do--you haven't done enough research for this to design it properly
which is a really good idea, and you coded it all without doing that
for isntance, if x allows a name that you do not, that's a problem, as you want useres to be able to take the same name
