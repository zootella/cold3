you are ready to code name-based sign up and sign in
which will use real tables and functions
even though it has the following simplifications
- all users have routes
- users identify themselves by their route
- "you are who you say you are" user validation for sign-in

from this first strand, though, you can code these features
[]a user has a status message
[]a user can change their status message, others can only view it
[]a user has a card that shows their status message
and you'll be able to code
[]a user hides and unhides themselves
[]a user closes their account



getting back to the cold forge,
find the existing tables, functions, and components which you have started building this in















site/stores/helloStore.js
v
site/server/api/hello1.js > demonstrationSignGet
site/server/api/hello2.js > demonstrationSignGet

site/server/api/authenticate.js
v
demonstrationSignGet > userToRoute
demonstrationSignUp > routeToUser, routeAdd
demonstrationSignIn > routeToUser
demonstrationSignOut

new functions to write and use instead:

site/server/api/hello1.js > browserToUser
site/server/api/hello2.js > somethingNew({browserTag}) => {userTag, routeText}

( ~ new stuff on top of that calls down to:)
browserToUser
browserSignIn
browserSignOut

( ~ new stuff on top of that calls down to:)
getName
setName
removeName
