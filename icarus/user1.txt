you are ready to code name-based sign up and sign in
which will use real tables and functions
even though it has the following simplifications
- all users have routes
- users identify themselves by their route
- "you are who you say you are" user validation for sign-in

from this first strand, though, you can code these features
[]a user has a status message
[]a user can change their status message, others can only view it
[]a user has a card that shows their status message
and you'll be able to code
[]a user hides and unhides themselves
[]a user closes their account



getting back to the cold forge,
find the existing tables, functions, and components which you have started building this in















./site/stores/helloStore.js
  v
./site/server/api/hello1.js > demonstrationSignHello
./site/server/api/hello2.js > demonstrationSignGet

./site/components/AuthenticateComponent.vue
./site/server/api/authenticate.js
  v
demonstrationSignGet
demonstrationSignUp
demonstrationSignIn
demonstrationSignOut

./icarus/level3.js

demonstrationSignHello > browser_get
demonstrationSignGet   > browser_get, name_get
demonstrationSignUp    >              name_get, name_set, browser_in
demonstrationSignIn    >              name_get,           browser_in
demonstrationSignOut   > demonstrationSignGet,                        browser_out

browser_get
browser_in
browser_out
TABLE browser_table (browser_tag, user_tag, level);

name_get
name_set
name_delete
TABLE name_table (user_tag, normal_text, formal_text, page_text);













uses of checkName
choose or change name
- changed contents of first box
- changed contents of second box
- ok to submit or submitted based on both boxes, on the page
- same thing as that, on the server
demonstration sign up
- typed in sign up box, forgiving
demonstration sign in
- typed in sign in box, forgiving
get to route
- GET to route, decide to 302 or 404 or 200







that's the schema, now here are the functions
a GET request has come in--do we have a user by that name? is the case correct, or should we redirect?
a user is trying to take a name--is it unique for them to take?
 
other user stuff, like status, avatar, goes in profile_table
but we do keep the user's name on the page here
because it's closely related to their route
and because we also want to enforce uniqueness there--we can't let two users both call themseves Tokyo❤️Girl, for instance
