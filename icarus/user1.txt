you are ready to code name-based sign up and sign in
which will use real tables and functions
even though it has the following simplifications
- all users have routes
- users identify themselves by their route
- "you are who you say you are" user validation for sign-in

from this first strand, though, you can code these features
[]a user has a status message
[]a user can change their status message, others can only view it
[]a user has a card that shows their status message
and you'll be able to code
[]a user hides and unhides themselves
[]a user closes their account



getting back to the cold forge,
find the existing tables, functions, and components which you have started building this in















./site/stores/helloStore.js
  v
./site/server/api/hello1.js > demonstrationSignHello
./site/server/api/hello2.js > demonstrationSignGet

./site/components/AuthenticateComponent.vue
./site/server/api/authenticate.js
  v
demonstrationSignGet
demonstrationSignUp
demonstrationSignIn
demonstrationSignOut

./icarus/level3.js

demonstrationSignHello > browser_get
demonstrationSignGet   > browser_get, name_get
demonstrationSignUp    >              name_get, name_set, browser_in
demonstrationSignIn    >              name_get,           browser_in
demonstrationSignOut   > demonstrationSignGet,                        browser_out

browser_get

browser_out
TABLE browser_table (browser_tag, user_tag, level);

name_get
