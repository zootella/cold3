robin will do two pretty cool things:
(1) if an external api breaks, even silently, robin will notice and immediately stop using it
(2) while several comparable apis are working, robin will know which one lets users complete tasks the fastest
and it does this not on simulated use, but rather watching real users' real interactions

the design is simple:
-the table schema is generalized so code can track a new resource and provider just by mentioning it
-p50 and p95 are calculated by postgres directly, so server code doesn't need to do that
-short term and full history tables allow for both moment to moment awareness, and a full historical record

//webgl render info didn't work for a hashed browser tag, but still include it as a query string
//show it to the user on their page of where you're signed in and have signed in






/*
so, browser tag below didn't work as a fingerprint

but you'll still need stuff like this to verbosely fingerprint:
the user's browser, as client code sees it, with stuff like the user agent string
an incoming client request, as a nuxt api handler sees it, with the supposed query string, ip address

totally make the page where the user sees their query string and ip address of their current and previous sessions
and you can include their webgl nvidia stuff there, also

~ security note ~

good security design is always a balance between security and usability

the goal is to keep the user signed in without expiration
and to keep that as secure as possible

this is not the current experience of the web, a short timeout, any IP address change, or any use from another device leads to automatic sign-out
and the poor user experience harms security, as users choose bad passwords, or discontinue using the site altogether

the only place i've noticed signin without expiration is facebook
i use facebook less than once a year, but whenever i go to facebook.com, im still signed in
meta likely has metrics that link signing out a user with losing that user

essentially, a browser is identified by a tag
and if a signed-in browser reports the same tag to the server, it's still signed in
but there are two security enhancements:

(1) scary naming
in local storage, the key and name look like this:
current_session_password: account_access_code_DO_NOT_SHARE_hi1y5ICjnEQLVDKtawm0C
imagine a n00b user is on a discord server or subreddit dedicated to power users of an instance of the platform, where a sophisticated attacker coaches users into compromising their accounts
warning language to the n00b may give them pause

(2) browser tag hashed, not sent
the browser tag is never sent to the server
the hash is never saved to the disk
if the user's disk or system is compromised, a rudimentary scanner can recover the browser tag, but must compute the hash

(3) hash is of tag and fingerprint
rather than hashing the tag alone, details specific to the browser are included in the data hashed
these details are designed to be specific to the user's device, but unlikely to change

7ms

concerns with fingerprinting and identifying the session:

pinia, shouldn't browserTag live there?

how long does this take? (7-10ms on your big windows desktop, measure on your phone)
you'll include it in every single API call, as it identifies who the caller at least says they are
you don't want it to slow down the very first page laod for the user
you can cache it for the whole session--in a global? in pinia?
you can't save it to local storage! or let pinia do this unknowingly!
you need to only await for it on the very first API call, not at the start of the first page load
