ok you're going to try Task without Tape
they're designed to be light and throwaway





















omg the stack is as tall as one of those three bread sandwiches

high level goals here:
[]standardize t1/t2/t3 and result/response/records on all levels
[]toss at every level of the stack, and understand how higher levels deal
[]experience non-exceptional failure at every level of the stack, and understand how higher levels deal
[]make sure that amazon details don't get sent to the page! be verbose in the worker, in datadog, not in the worker's response!

and here's where you clean up
[]single lambda warm that doesn't take provider or service, it's acting like a monolith
[]origin23 and fetch23, and how tests use them
[]getting the reference to $fetch where you need it

general patterns:

t1, t2, t3 - always have all three (even if you don't need t2), report duration = t3-t1

result
  .response
    .records

[i] the page

PostButton, codeStore, random other components
$fetch() to the worker below

[ii] the worker

./site/server/api/name.js
most just finish and return, but some
fetch23() to the lambda below

[iii] the lambda

./net23/src/message.js
calls amazon and twilio apis, which have their own exceptions and results


page success, page failure, page exception
worker success, worker failure, worker exception
lambda success, lambda failure, lambda exception






first just get it working again






get things running again
make a [Spelunk] button that reaches down to lambda






	/*
	you get:
	result                  - our summary from the page's perspective of how the fetch went
	result.response         - the response body from the server
	result.response.records - records in List format with .tick and .tag for a pinia store
	*/



you built symmetry into door, but realize that thta design may not be optimal
for instance, it's important if the worker door handle below throws, that we datadog that, and not tell the page all the details
but the lambda can only be called by the page, so maybe it always returns full details
and the net23 does the job of logging things, including failures persephone experienced from apis
or, this is crazy, it's easiest to handle things right wehre they happen, and you've gotten datadog reliable from lambda no problem
and also, you haven't used supabase from lambda yet, so that's already all on in the worker


you find yourself cooking up this idea where passed through the whole handler is an array where operations add reports, like turnstile is a report, a call to amazon is a report
which means that you don't have this deeply nested thing with sometimes multiple hardcoded responses inside
but don't do that now, if ever!



ugh what might the ledger look like
it woudl only be in the worker, the lambda reports back everything
a ledger item would have:
.t1 and .t2 and .duration
.sticker
.tag, identifier of the ledger item itself
.success
.provider, .service
.call
.request
.response

you could log an alert to datadog all at once at the end if there is any failure, or if something took too long
and log to datadog only from the worker, also

not response, but receipt







right now all you're trying to do is
[]chart the existing course
[]check api results for non success no throw
[]copy up success false
[]test out exceptions to see what to expect
[]keep times in there in a standard way even if you don't use them

what would it look like to pass around a really simple receipt

the door gives you a tape object
you add to it with tape.add({detail1, detail2, detail3}), there are required details
you merge it into the resposnse body


doorHandleBelow({door, body, action, tape})


ok and then how does it work with network 23
you pass net23 tape
it doesn't post it to the lambda
but does merge in the response

this is only a good idea if it means that you can keep the returns from these functions, and api handlers, really simple now, like true or false, even(?!) because tape has all the details
it means you don't have to buidl up this big deep tree as you go along

ok, see what adding this looks like




and now you realize, you give call a function and have it run it, and automatically catch an error and fail with it
weird, this is getting complicated like door
and also stepping on door's toes, somewhat
code it separate first, or not at all



Tape holds a list of
Call objects

let call = Call()//sets t1






success//looking at the response, not just for an error
	true to keep going; if false won't keep going


	vv optional to also pass in at the end

error, if there was one
guide//short human readable guidance for the user

	vv set internally:

t1
t2 == tick
duration
tag//identifies this call object
sticker//sticker where we did the call


body
request
response
result
records

logged


call.




ok, you coded up Task and Tape
and the're small and tight
keep them that way

next, try to use them to remove code around $fetch and api calls
leaving the return values just the minimal required for flow
essentially, see if Task and Tape help you remove a lot of details that most of the time aren't necessary


you can use Task both places
but probably only use Tape on the server

[]get Task to not include .error at all unless there is an error!





issues monday afternoon:

(1)
be careful that net23 doesn't leak secrets
if there's a valid access code, then it's ok to put lots of details in the response
but otherwise, it's a public api, so you can't allow any detail into the response, imagining that only a valid worker will be calling it!

(2)
you've written a simple Task that bubbles up success
but, using it, you find yourself checking if (task.success)
and then continuing
which seems wrong, that's what exceptions are for



you do like isolating higher risk blocks of code in try catch
let's say sesclient.send throws
what does that mean?
it means it's staff's fault, either an error in configuration, or usage
you do want to get that into datadog, but right now it's not going there






const tape = Tape()

	/*
	now you suspect instead of writing Task and Tape, it's actually just about letting exceptions bubble all the way up from perspechone through here, which is much nicer!

	remember, we want to use exceptions for 'the platform is broken' situations
	here, this should always work--network 23 should be able to send a message
	so just confirm that if there's a problem with either the lambda
	or the amazon api, this leads to a thrown exception in the lambda
	which leads to a 500 from the fetch
	which leads to an exception that gets thrown up through here
	which goes all the way back to the page, and, i suppose, an exception there

since adding sharp to lambdas, you've seen reliability problems!
like a 500 internal server error that is corrected by hitting refresh in the browser
and, the cold start is apparent now--a first hit in the morning takes seconds, then after that it's fast
so make this bridge first hit a wakup endpoint, and then do the real request
this simple stateless workaround won't slow things down much and is way easier than trying to clean up a failed request will preventing duplicate stateful real world action, like sending the user two text messages instead of one

ok, the flow is
1 do warm call
2 if failed, do warm call again
3 do real call

and log alerts when second warm call fails, meaning you don't try
or second warm call succeeds, meaning you fixed it but that was weird

==== comments, bottom to top...

when using Task, check code for .success = true and .finish()

patterns developing:
- yes, you might catch an exception in the lambda, but then rethrow based on a failed task in the woker
- endpoints can return the result of a function call, rather than bundling things deep
- functions that get called by endpoints should return tasks




~~~~ send.js
the response body of the worker call is the object codeSend() returns
it's not a task, but does have a .success

~~~~ level3.js:codeSend()
saves the task from fetch23()--again, we're saving tasks rather than making and wrapping them, which is great
tosses to prevent keeping going, that pattern here again, also
doesn't return a task--rather returns an object with .success and minimal details, as this will be the body back to the page
this object, let's call it the response, even though it's never named, also has .codes for the pinia store

~~~~ level2.js:fetch23()
calls $fetch twice, saving, rather than making and wrapping, the tasks
checks the warm task for success, but then throws the task away
returns the actual task

~~~~ message.js
the response body of the lambda call is the task the functions return

~~~~ persephone.js
you've got tasks around warm and SESClient
warm lets an exception toss up, as this would indicate a code error
sesclient protects send with a try catch, as this is way more likely, if you've misconfigured amazon email, or they're misbehaving
this is also where you logAlert to datadog--tossing here wouldn't get the local context!
you return the task, which could contain secrets, but that's ok because the caller is a validated worker
note that if there was no keycard, door would have already thrown a detail-free 500





observe these three:
[x]happy path
[x]throw in block, no Destination
[x]throw in function
[x]throw in file



[~]just make a separate lambda endpoint which does nothing named warm

[x]refactor persephone unifying the four
[x]test the other three, happy path
[x]add success sanity checks to all four

[x]use Task in PostButton
[x]add the return codes records to codeStore


[x]CodeRequestComponent merges in return codes
[]CodeEnterComponent also works through the store to keep things in sync
