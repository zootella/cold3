omg the stack is as tall as one of those three bread sandwiches

high level goals here:
[]toss at every level of the stack, and understand how higher levels deal
[]experience non-exceptional failure at every level of the stack, and understand how higher levels deal
[]make sure that amazon details don't get sent to the page! be verbose in the worker, in datadog, not in the worker's response!

and here's where you clean up
[x]single lambda warm that doesn't take provider or service, it's acting like a monolith
[x]origin23 and fetch23, and how tests use them
[x]getting the reference to $fetch where you need it

page success, page failure, page exception
worker success, worker failure, worker exception
lambda success, lambda failure, lambda exception




================================================================================

you built symmetry into door, but realize that thta design may not be optimal
for instance, it's important if the worker door handle below throws, that we datadog that, and not tell the page all the details
but the lambda can only be called by the page, so maybe it always returns full details
and the net23 does the job of logging things, including failures persephone experienced from apis
or, this is crazy, it's easiest to handle things right wehre they happen, and you've gotten datadog reliable from lambda no problem
and also, you haven't used supabase from lambda yet, so that's already all on in the worker
