ttd april2025 note to remove tests from production
does including tiny tests in nuxt mean the whole bundle, even in production, is unnecessarily larger?
you may want to comment this out at the end
there's also process.env.NODE_ENV != 'production'

if you take a look at this, also look at the static imports in level1
maybe they should be dynamic imports to get out of the starting required client bundle
and only get prefetched when an input box expects an email or phone number
you think switching to dynamic will be difficult because the async will spread up the chain in validation
but let you keep that code in icarus level1
alternatively, you keep it static, but then have to move it out of level1 to a separate file

the other way to make the first required home route client bundle really small is to have it be a static brochure page
and once you code such a page, tree shaking and client bundle optimization may make this happen automatically, anyway
ok, so several concerns there about initial page load, bundle size

$ yarn size
and then you see these in the default bundle
