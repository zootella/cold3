/*
ok so imagine you just use defineExpose all the time
SignComponent on mounted gets the browser tag, and fetches to find out if we're signed in
same pattern of, if in flight of that request, a call from above also wants to know, the second waits for the first
and cache the sign status--if you ask again it doesn't fetch again

export functions are:
await signIn(password) - true signed in now or false bad password
await signOut()
await signStatus() - true or false we're signed in
and they throw on other problems, considered exceptional

but then the question is likely going to be--does this need to be a component?
could it be a function in level2 that you only call onMounted, instead?
this was what happened with getBrowserTag when you tried to make it a component

the component might be useful to hold the state
and really shows that this code is only for a page running with the user
