this is the "credential panel" component
a signed in user can navigate to their account dashboard to see and control information about their account
as part of that long scrolling page, this credential panel is a box that will tell the user information
like their name, and that they have set a password
this is also where controls exist that let the signed in user change these credentials, for instance they might
change their user name, or
change their password
