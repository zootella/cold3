stuff you'll figure out here
- can you make <PostButton /> and <TurnstilePostButton /> that are easy to use, reduce code duplication, and take care of themselves?
- how should vue components communicate? the framework provides many different ways. can you use await, or do you have to wire up events and listeners?
- how does a form work when there are multiple steps?
- does icarus have form-wide validation functions, like validateSomeForm(), which both the vue component and api handler can use?
- how do exceptions work? can you toss in an api handler, catch around $fetch, and still show a message to the user?
- are you going to use <form @submit.prevent="">? are you going to use <input enterkeyhint="">
- you already have class="pushy" and class="linky"
- you'll figure out having both :class="refButtonState" and class="pushy", which works, but you're not sure how





in SnippetComponent.vue is an exploration of dynamic, static, and regular properties?




make a simple working form with a field, a button that posts
and then with chat refactor the button into a component
you must tell the button when the form is ready or not (or, give the button the form fields to watch, and the validator to determine if their contents mean things are ready)
and then get from the button when it's done
but teh button should take care of the fetch, catching exceptions, turning different colors and styles, all that
and it should be easy to switch between StepButton, PostButton, and TurnstilePostButton, ideally just as easy as naming them




ways vue components can communicate


now, let's take a step back.
let's talk about vue patterns and apis generally
i want to focus on what's easy, mainstream, and correct for modern vue, using the composition api
the area i want to learn about is the different ways parent and child components communicate.
what are different choices to accomplish this?
what are the ramifications as to capability and simplicity are in each of those choices?
my goal is to enumerate them, understand each, and learn how each tool is intended, where it's a good choice, where it's not a good choice, to select the right tool for the job

i've heard about these features of vue which are related to component communication:
- Props and Custom Events (Emits)
- v-model (Two-Way Binding)
- Provide/Inject
- Refs to Access Child Component Methods/Properties
- defineExpose({childComponentFunction})

generally, im always interested in short, simple, complete, and common patterns, following standards and best practices. 

in a sense, im trying to learn the "right" way to solve a problem, as intended by platform creators and community, and learn how within that way, i can accomplish some particular objectives





notes for each of these

1

i need to be able to run some code when the button clicks, as i can do here:

async function clickedButton() {
	//log('the user clicked the button!')
	let f = await buttonFetch({
		inFlight: refInFlight,//give the buttonFetch function the reference to our inFlight, so it can enable and color the button correctly
		path: '/api/form',
		body: {
			action: 'SubmitNote.',
			browserTag: helloStore.browserTag,
			note: refNote.value,
		},
	})
	log('the button finished its tasks!', look(f))
}

2







so PostButton should pickup and include browserTag in body automatically











using what we've learned and the choices we've made here, now, let's take a step back. here are some code snippets written by other team members from this project as a whole:

	<p><button @click="refState = 1" class="linky">{{'<'}} Back</button></p>
	<p>Hello new person! To sign up, choose a new user name for yourself:</p>
	<p>
		<input type="text" v-model="refDesiredUserNameBox" placeholder="desired user name" />{{' '}}
		<button @click="clickedSignUp()" class="pushy">Sign Up</button>
	</p>

the pushy and linky css classes, defined in our site-wide tailwind css, make linky buttons resemble links, and style pushy buttons to look like buttons. neither of these two buttons do anything other than run the @click function specified, and that's fine--they're intended as simple ways to get a user's intent into execution in our script setup block

<div>
	<p>
		<NuxtLink to="/">index</NuxtLink>{{' - '}}
		<NuxtLink to="/ping/test">test</NuxtLink>{{' '}}
		<NuxtLink to="/door">door</NuxtLink>{{' - '}}
		<NuxtLink to="/image">image</NuxtLink>{{' '}}

for navigation around the site, we use NuxtLink, which is provided by nuxt. here, we want the route to change, and the back button to work

ok, so based on that, now here's my question. what might it look like to create three new very simple (probably only several line) components, called:

LinkButton - internally, will have a button and style it linky; the parent component will set @click
StepButton - same as that, except will style it with the pushy class, instead
Link - simply an alternative name for NuxtLink, for readability
