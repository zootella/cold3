draft names before rename:

looks like a link; navigates to a route:               Navigate        -->  RouteLink
looks like a button; navigates to a route:             NavigateButton  -->  RouteButton
looks like a link; runs a given function:              LinkButton      -->  ClickLink
looks like a button; runs a given function:            Button          -->  ClickButton
looks like a button; POSTs optionally with turnstile:                       PostButton

make sure you type things to bring up the right mobile keyboard!
you've been using number pad, but there's also email and url!

<input type="tel" />    <!-- triggers number pad -->
<input type="email" />  <!-- triggers email keyboard -->
<input type="url" />    <!-- triggers URL keyboard with .com key -->
