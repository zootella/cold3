make sure you type things to bring up the right mobile keyboard!
you've been using number pad, but there's also email and url!

<input type="tel" />    <!-- triggers number pad -->
<input type="email" />  <!-- triggers email keyboard -->
<input type="url" />    <!-- triggers URL keyboard with .com key -->
