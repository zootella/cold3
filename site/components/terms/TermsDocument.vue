<script setup>//./components/TermsDocument.vue - vue component to hold lengthy terms text and internal styling and wrapping rules

/*
notes about a component that contains a long document

even if this document is long, and the user's connection is slow,
using it in a form step won't cause any noticeable delay
you're getting desired behavior for free, all from Nuxt defaults

to observe all this, we used Project Gutenberg's War and Peace, which is over 3 megabytes of text
including it on a static linked page, and also in a component you can navigate to
$ yarn size - and then look at client.html and nitro.html
$ yarn build
$ find .output -type f -size +100k -exec ls -lh {} \;
-rw-r--r--@ 1 3.4M .output/public/_nuxt/Kdj9aVdZ.js
-rw-r--r--@ 1 3.4M .output/server/chunks/build/TolstoyDocument-Bvg9hSF1.mjs

both of these files are Vue components that contain the minified HTML of Tolstoy's masterpiece
Nuxt uses the server component when a new tab's starting GET is to /terms so the document is part of the server render
the public component gets used when the page, already loaded, clicks into a route which has the document
for both, compression happens, but on the wire, not in the built files at rest

if the first navigation is to a route, like the root, that doesn't use TermsDocument,
the long document doesn't get sent or slow anything down

if a user moves from one route to another that both have TermsDocument,
the second use comes out of the browser cache, not a second download across the wire

but typically, Nuxt will prefetch TermsDocument into the browser's cache *before* the user clicks to need it
NuxtLink uses an IntersectionObserver to prefetch the TermsDocument chunk when the user scrolls a link into view
and there will be a link to /terms at the bottom of every page, and that page has TermsDocument

or, to be really fancy, you could, in the step before the agree to terms step, force the prefetch with code like this:

if (thisIsTheStepBeforeTerms) import('~/components/TermsDocument.vue')

import is the JavaScript dynamic import function, which returns a Promise that here, we discard
Nuxt also provides APIs like usePrefetchComponent or router.prefetchLinks for more granular control over prefetching,
but using import to fetch components is standard as well,
and we don't really need this at all because it's likely NuxtLink from some footer already prefeteched TermsDocument

<h2>2.9. Your rights and choices regarding your personal data</h2>
<p>Please email <em><a href="mailto:poo@example.com">poo@example.com</a></em> if you want to make use of any of your below-mentioned legal rights.</p>
<h3>2.9.1. Where you are a resident of the EU</h3>
<p>Subject to certain exceptions and the jurisdiction in which you live, if you are a resident of the EU, the GDPR provides you with specific rights regarding your personal data.
This subsection describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights regarding personal data that we hold about you.
These rights include:</p>
<h4>2.9.1.1. The right of access</h4>
<p>You can <strong>access all personal data we hold about you, know the origin of this personal data and obtain a copy in an understandable format</strong>.
You may also use your right to access your personal data to control the exactness of the data and have them rectified or deleted.
You have no justification to provide to exercise your right to access;</p>
<h4>2.9.1.2. The right to rectification</h4>
<p>In order to avoid inaccurate or incomplete personal data relating to you is processed or shared, you can ask us to rectify them;</p>
<h4>2.9.1.3. The right to erasure</h4>
<p>You may request the erasure or deletion of the personal data we hold on you.
This is not an absolute right since we may have to keep your personal data for legal or legitimate reasons.
You may, for example, exercise your right to deletion in the following cases:</p>
<p>โข if you have withdrawn your consent to the processing (see below);</p>
<p>โข if you legitimately objected to the processing of your data (see below);</p>
<p>โข when data is not or is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was initially collected or processed;</p>
<p>โข the data is processed unlawfully (e.g., publishing hacked data);</p>
<h4>2.9.1.4. The right to object to the processing of your personal data</h4>
<p>We process your personal data based on our legitimate interest (to determine to which processing this applies, please refer above in this privacy notice), you may at any time object to the processing of your personal data for reasons relating to your personal situation.
We may nevertheless, on a case-by-case basis, reject such a request by pointing out the legitimate and imperious reasons justifying the processing of this data which prevail on your interests, rights and freedoms, or when this data is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a right before a Court.</p>
<h4>2.9.1.5. The right to restrict processing</h4>
<p>The right to limit the processing <strong>completes your other rights</strong>.
This right means that <strong>the data processing relating to you and that we are performing is limited, so we may keep this data, but we cannot use it or process it in any other manner</strong>.
This right applies in specific circumstances, i.e.:</p>
<p>โข if you challenge the exactness of your personal data.
The processing is then limited for a period of time so that the agency may verify the exactness of the personal data;</p>
<p>โข if the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of your personal data and request instead that its use be limited;</p>
<p>โข if we do not need the personal data for the purposes mentioned above anymore, but you still need it to establish, exercise or defend rights before a Court; and</p>
<p>โข in the cases where you objected to the processing which is based on the legitimate interests of the agency, you may ask to limit the processing for the time necessary for us to verify if we can accept your objection request (i.e., the time necessary to verify whether the legitimate reasons of the agency prevail over yours).</p>
<h4>2.9.1.6. The right to object to data processing for direct marketing purpose</h4>
<p>You may unsubscribe or object, at any time and without any justification, to the reception of direct marketing communications.
Simply either (a) reply STOP to a SMS text message you receive from us; (b) click on the link in the footer of the email communications you receive from us; or (c) send us an email at <em><a href="mailto:poo@example.com">poo@example.com</a></em> with the word <em>unsubscribe</em> in the subject field of the email.</p>
<h4>2.9.1.7. The right to data portability</h4>
<p>โข You may request to <strong>retrieve the personal data you provided us with</strong>, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, for personal use or to share them with a third party of your choice.</p>

<h1 id="sms">4. SMS and MMS terms and conditions</h1>
<p><strong>How the site uses SMS.</strong> The site uses SMS text messages for user identification purposes.
These purposes include: allowing a user to sign up, identifying a returning user who wishes to sign in, preventing a user from making multiple accounts, and generally demonstrating that a user has control of a mobile phone number.
When you opt in to the service, the site will send you one SMS text message per user action, such as pressing a button to receive a code, as performed by you.</p>
<p><strong>Optional use.</strong>
Use of SMS on the site is optional for the user.
The information a new user sees when choosing how to sign up indicates that it is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to use.</strong>
A user does not need to use SMS to use any of the services of the website.
For example, instead of signing in with SMS, a user can choose to sign in with email.
Or, instead of signing in with SMS every time, a user can add a password to their account, and then sign in with that password.
Users can change their preferences related to how they sign in, and how that method uses SMS, during account creation and at any time after account creation, in account settings.</p>
<p><strong>Use is upon user action.</strong>
The site sends a user an SMS message when the user clicks a button to explicitly perform that action.
For instance, a user may have chosen to receive a message, and then press a button labeled <em>Send Code</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords.</strong>
The site sends SMS messages from one or several toll-free numbers.
You can cancel SMS service from a toll-free number at any time by texting STOP in response to a message.
When you text STOP to a toll-free number, your mobile carrier will reply with an SMS message that confirms that you have been unsubscribed.
After this, you won't be able to receive any additional messages from that number.
To again be able to use SMS from us, reply with UNSTOP.</p>
<p>For toll-free numbers like those we use, the keyword opt-out and opt-in responses are set at the carrier level, using STOP and UNSTOP.
These are the only keywords that you can use, and we cannot modify them.
Response messages when you reply with STOP and UNSTOP are also managed by the carrier.</p>
<p>If you have chosen to sign in with SMS codes, but then reply to a message with STOP, we will be unable to deliver codes.
This may prevent you from being able to sign in using this method.
If you wish to use this method again, text UNSTOP, and request another code.
Alternatively, sign in using an alternative means previously configured, like a password.
Or, recover your account through additional identifying means, such as email.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting use.</strong>
Our site identifies users by combining several pieces of sign-in information, like date of birth, phone number, email address, and password.
A third party that knows a user's phone number will be prevented from using the site to cause the site to send a message to that phone number by not knowing additional corresponding sign-in information for that user.</p>
<p><strong>Security.</strong>
Our site stores all personal and user information, including date of birth and telephone number, securely.
Website systems are secure with API keys.
These keys are kept secure in serverless cloud secrets vaults.
In maintaining and improving the site, these keys are only accessed by authorized staff members using secure devices.
Additionally, in the unlikely event of a data breach, sensitive user data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest.
The site employs strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive user information.</p>
<p><strong>Carriers.</strong>
We are able to deliver messages to the following mobile phone carriers: Major carriers: AT&#x26;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, MetroPCS, US Cellular, Alltel, Boost Mobile, Nextel, and Virgin Mobile.
Minor carriers: Alaska Communications Systems (ACS), Appalachian Wireless (EKN), Bluegrass Cellular, Cellular One of East Central IL (ECIT), Cellular One of Northeast Pennsylvania, Cincinnati Bell Wireless, Cricket, Coral Wireless (Mobi PCS), COX, Cross, Element Mobile (Flat Wireless), Epic Touch (Elkhart Telephone), GCI, Golden State, Hawkeye (Chat Mobility), Hawkeye (NW Missouri), Illinois Valley Cellular, Inland Cellular, iWireless (Iowa Wireless), Keystone Wireless (Immix Wireless/PC Man), Mosaic (Consolidated or CTC Telecom), Nex-Tech Wireless, NTelos, Panhandle Communications, Pioneer, Plateau (Texas RSA 3 Ltd), Revol, RINA, Simmetry (TMP Corporation), Thumb Cellular, Union Wireless, United Wireless, Viaero Wireless, and West Central (WCC or 5 Star Wireless).
Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
<p><strong>Cost.</strong>
Message and data rates may apply for any messages that we send to you or you send to us.
You will receive one message per identification action.
Contact your wireless provider for more information about your text plan or data plan.
