/*


factory settings are how many posts, like 40
and how many a tip too small are, like /4=10

but obviously make sure there's no way that it creates an oscillation where once the infinity happens, it needs to immediately take action again

plan out the algorithm on paper!
there could be very few posts,
very short posts,
a very very tall computer monitor, etc

keep /feed and /infinity separate
