plan out the algorithm on paper!
there could be very few posts,
very short posts,
a very very tall computer monitor, etc

watch out for oscillations!

ok, now on day 4, infinite scrolling has become a quagmire
current solution works on desktop, not mobile
on desktop, works, but messes up dragging the scrollbar, which is annoying
on mobile, adding or removing from above the fold doesn't keep the current post in view, and creates an infinite loop of removing posts
popular platforms never remove from the top, instead just adding to the bottom until the tab runs out of memory
it's possible that your components will be so efficient that you could survive the memory issue
possible solutions at this point:

(1) affect the scroll
there are javascript apis to scroll, window.scrollBy(0, -heightDifference) and window.scroll
when adding or removing posts above, you could measure the distance below, add or remove, and then scroll so there's the same distance below
but this could deepen the quagmire
then three things would be scrolling: the user, the browser, and the page!
when you tell vue to affect the post list, it doesn't do it immediately--you've already demonstrated not being able to get a revised total page height right away

(2) posts out of field switch to lightweight divs of the same height
the vue list will have to be of PostOrSpacerComponent components
and then the feed tells them to be a post or a spacer
immediately on scroll, spacers need to become posts
after the 4s cooldown, distant posts can become spacers
it's easy to get to and change properties of individual items in the list:

	<PostOrSpacerComponent
		v-for="post in visiblePosts"
		:key="post.tag"
		:show="true" ... />

	visiblePosts.value[index].show = false

you still have to pass all the properties Post needs through PostOrSpacer
you're not coding this now, but are confident you could
also, the page can ask the browser how much memory its using with performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory().bytes
something you like about this solution is while the desktop scrollbar is wonky going down, it always works to drag it up--dragging all the way up to get the menu may be a frequent user activity

also, you do eventually want a pagination option
probably as a route rather than a setting
so users who want it can find it, while infinite scroll is always the default
