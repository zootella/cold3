//ttd july, this defines the card for the home page, but how do you set a generic site card for every page that isn't user generated? so that if someone links cold3.cc/terms, for instance, they don't get a terms card, that would be silly, but they do get the same card as for cold3.cc But also, of course, if it's a route to a user page or post, then the card is specific to that user generated content
