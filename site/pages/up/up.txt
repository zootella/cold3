the new tests page, with
[x]separated server and client rendering
[x]a refresh button on the page
[x]dynamic loading of worker and lambda tests, so you don't have to wait to navigate in
[]unlike everywhere else, catch an error, and show it in a <pre>, be able to make a mess in a test anywhere in the stack, persephone, an api endpoint, and see what went wrong exactly on the page



notes from early run:

KEVHNPK CloudPageServer 0ms ✅ 672 assertions in 76 tests on Mon05:47p33.498s
KEVHNPK CloudPageClient 18ms ✅ 674 assertions in 77 tests on Mon05:47p33.718s
KEVHNPK CloudNuxtServer 0ms ✅ 674 assertions in 77 tests on Mon05:47p33.824s
KEVHNPK CloudLambda 322ms ✅ 680 assertions in 81 tests on Mon05:47p34.821s Reload


maybe show outer and inner times, as the lambda ran tests for 322ms, but the fourth line takes a full second to arrive, as evidenced by the on times on the right

also, how is 0ms possible? it's not; measure the actual durations correctly for nuxt server render and api handler
