talk about
- Task as a wrapper
- unwrapping before passing up to not let things go deeper and deeper
- exceptions as truly exceptional (summarized below)

treat unexpected exceptions as fatal issues that indicate a bug in the code rather than as a part of normal control flow—the recommended Nuxt 3 configuration and practices shift toward a “fail fast” approach. This means that rather than attempting to recover from errors or provide graceful degradation, you let exceptions bubble up to a global error handler, log them appropriately, and present a clear, interruptive error page to users.

we don't follow nuxt patterns precisely, because we're vendor isomorphic between workers and lambdas

but reading

https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error


Nuxt 3—with its underlying Nitro engine—mainly expects you to handle server-side errors by letting them bubble up and then catching them using Nitro’s built‐in hooks (like the render:errorMiddleware hook). This is the recommended and most common approach because it captures a wide range of errors that occur during request processing, including those that arise from internal configuration or runtime code that you might not directly control.








stop trying to register every handler and catch every error

realize that you can't catch errors on the margin of an icarus file
nor a persephone file
nor on the margin of a component's script setup; if you try to make one there, things don't even build

do choose some common error locations, you've marked with errorspot, and confirm that errors there are handled the way you want
- which is, if on the server, to log to datadog, and then make the page error.vue
- and if, on the client, to log to the browser console.error, make the page error.vue, where there is a button, that uses turnstile, that logs the error to a new /server/src/error.js endpoint

and for errorspot, you have a lot of quick manual testing to do
each errorspot

Vue’s Native Error Handler (vueApp.config.errorHandler):
This is Vue’s built‐in mechanism for catching errors in rendering, lifecycle hooks, and some component code. It’s very low level and gets triggered when Vue itself encounters an exception.

Nuxt’s vue:error Hook:
This hook is provided by Nuxt and catches errors within the Vue component system. In practice, its scope overlaps strongly with what Vue’s native error handler already does. Many of the errors you’d catch here are also caught by the native config.errorHandler.

Nuxt’s app:error Hook:
This is a broader hook that catches errors in the application outside of the Vue component lifecycle—for example during SSR rendering or plugin initialization. It gives you access to errors that occur “above” the component system.

hitStore.js

ttd february important
ok, but if a whole bunch of components show up on the page all at once
and they all call into getHits at the same time
coded this way, there will be a flurry of overlapping and identical fetch calls
so you need to isolate this as follows:
- if there's a fetch in flight, another one doesn't begin
- and you need to do the fancy promise thing where after the first or going fetch finishes, any number of await-ers all return at once

and you realized you need both protections
wrap this with sequentialShared - prevents multiple calls from overlapping on the page or cloud sides
and also leave gotten - prevents a second unnecessary call on the client side

also because action is different, you can't sequentialShared _fetchHit
you've got to add a layer between the calls above and _fetchHit below

	/*
	without registering error handlers, Nuxt 

	in our application, we treat all exceptions as critical: the user should be shown the error page; Datadog should wake up the developer on pager duty

	code can run on the client; code can run on the server
	code can run to create a Pinia store; render a component; handle an API request, or more
	and, remember the cross tabs! hybrid rendering means 
	but remember the cross-tabs! hybrid rendering
	code can run to respond to an API endpoint,

	"on the client"

	*/


look at this combination:
local and then deployed
no handler registered
an exception in the hit endpoint
which gets called on the server, as index page -> hit component -> hit store -> hit endpoint






no errors at all, here's what you've wired up:
- index is empty
- page1 is empty
- page2 has <HitComponent /> which uses hitStore, which fetches from hit.js

navigate to root, then click to page2
LocalPageClient shows starting number
LocalPageClient shows incremented number after you press the hit button

refresh on page2
LocalPageServer shows starting number (the pinia store hydrated on the server; the hit went across the bridge)
LocalPageClient shows incremented number after you press the hit button



ok, let's focus on notDefined in hit.js, down in the api endpoint, with both server and then client code reaching it, in those two flows


with compon



here's the behavior you're seeing by default, with a console logging handler reigstered, and not registered
if the error happens on the page, like you navigate not to a page with the hit directly
the error happens, leaves the pages in a weird broken state, clicking to a different route works, recoveres from it, never get to the error page
but if you navigate a tab directly to a route where the error is going to happen on the server
then the page goes to the error page, which is what you want
