	errors; summary of findings and decisions:
	- you can't catch errors on the margin; nuxt won't build
	- you can't catch every error; the seams where the platform and framework parts come together are too numerous and arcane
	- remember that while api endpoints only run on the server, plugins, stores, and components run both places
	- we're treating exceptions as truly exceptional: the page should interrupt the user, going full error; datadog should wake up staff on pager duty
	- on the server, we can log to datadog directly; on the client, we can post to a logger, protected by a button click and turnstile
	- an error anywhre in the three layer stack should go up to the page, both posting to datadog and making the page full error
