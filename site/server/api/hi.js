/api/hi
needs to be fast, as will delay site delivery
can't run on hybrid server hydration, as real page must post browser tag


first, understand how these do and should run:

app.vue
index.vue



im coding a full stack javascript website, as an example to define patterns for my team. the stack we've chosen is nuxt 3, using vue's composition api, and pinia, using pinia's setup stores api. we're deploying to cloudflare pages, and set up the repository with create cloudflare cli and cloudflare wrangler. i added pinia using nuxt's pinia module. all of this is working well.

looking at the project to begin, here are some files:

./app.vue
./layouts/layout1.vue
./pages/index.vue
./stores/store1.js

show me minimal examples for the contents of these, with them all hooked together. then we'll talk about what code runs when, and how to keep things structured correctly for fast page loads, following nuxt best practices and the indended use from official documentation

at a detailed, under-the-hood level, i want to understand how nuxt runs my code
in the situation of, a new browser navigates to the root domain for the first time
my understanding is that first code will run on the server, in hybrid rendering
then, once delivered to the client, code will again run

i have made a pinia store in store1.js
my intent is to keep this store small and simple, efficient to be fast
because, the information in this store will be necessary for the first page that is delivered

information in this store can be divided into two categories

first, some information the store contains will be based only on the GET request that came to cloudflare
for instance, if the url the client requests is:
https://example.com/CoolUser1999
on server hydration as a part of hybrid rendering, my code will look up this user by their username, CoolUser1999
and then deliver a page that includes this user's status, something like "partying like it's 1999"
the client may be a search engine spider that can download pages but not run javascript
so, information like this needs to be pre-hydrated
but also--this flow must be fast, because if it's slow, it will slow down every page load for every type of user and first hit scenario!

the second category is information based on what the browser tells the worker in an initial, immediate POST
for instance, a browser has a browser tag, which identifies this browser and device to the server
there may be a user signed-in here--the way we tell that is this:
1 the browser makes a GET request to the server
2 the server sends a filled-in page based on information from that GET request
3 the browser, running code in the page, immediately POSTs to a server endpoint with its browser tag
4 the server looks up more details based on the ip address and browser tag, and replies to the page
5 the browser, with information from that POST response, adds information to the components of the page

so that's a standard flow for running nuxt 3 on cloudflare
(but also, is this summary of what happens correct?)
then ill ask another question--right now, let's just check and confirm my priors, please

my question is, where in
