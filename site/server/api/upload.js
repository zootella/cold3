hi claude, ok so as we continue along teh plan in media.md, my guess is that the nuxt page will need to talk to the nuxt worker
to begin, for instance, to get a valid envelope to use as permission when the page talks directly to the new /upload lambda, for instance
if that's the case, here's the file for that endpoint
when making a new endpoint, please of course follow the patterns and use the helpers of other endpoints you see nearby
