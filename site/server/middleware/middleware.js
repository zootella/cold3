/*
Cloudflare Workers run *in front of* the CDN, not behind it. A response generated by the worker goes straight to the client — Cloudflare's CDN never sees it, never caches it, regardless of the Cache-Control header in our response.

To get CDN caching, the worker must explicitly use the Cloudflare Cache API (caches.default), which writes to the same edge cache the CDN uses. This middleware handles both cache reads and writes:

hit  → serve from edge cache (~1-5ms), nothing downstream runs
miss → invoke our own fetch handler via the SELF service binding (wrangler.jsonc), which re-enters
       the worker on the same thread without going through the CDN (avoiding the 522 loop detection
       that kills a plain fetch() self-request). The bypass header lets middleware10 pass through on
       the subrequest so nuxt-og-image renders the png, and we store it in the edge cache for next time.

/*
a tag identifies a browser, through multiple different signed-in users, and even before someone has signed up
we could keep the browser tag in local storage, except then:
(1) the server doesn't have it from the very first GET; page code has to POST it to the server after loading
(2) malicious script on the page, most likely a browser extension, can see and leak the browser tag; this is a significant security advantage to cookies, as many users, even on chromebooks, have malicious extensions

moving the browser tag into a 🍪 leaves behind the following advantages of local storage, though:
(3) there was no expiration date; local storage is meant to persist indefinitely
mitigated by:
	(3a) Safari and all browsers on iPhone can purge both cookies *and* localStorage after 7 days of user inactivity under Intelligent Tracking Prevention (Apple cloyingly pitches ITP as user protection; it also allows Apple to restrict web apps it cannot review, tax, and ban)
	(3b) we set our cookie to expire in 395 days (under Chrome’s 400‑day cap) and refresh that TTL on every visit
(4) optics are farther from regulatory scrutiny; as a 🖕-you to obtrusive, protectionless regulation, we could proudly state, "This site doesn’t even use cookies!"
mitigated by:
	(4a) privacy laws like GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive apply equally to any client‑side identifier, not just cookies
	(4b) because our tag cookie is first‑party, strictly‑necessary for core functionality, marked HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Lax, compliance requires documenting its use in a privacy policy, and does not require explicit user consent
